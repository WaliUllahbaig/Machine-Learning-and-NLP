Coronavirus is a family of viruses that are named after their spiky crown. The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first 
reported in Wuhan, China. On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This notebook aims at 
exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and projections.

Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an infectious spreading disease,which is casued by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-Cov-2).This disease was first 
found in 2019 in Wuhan distirct of China, and is spreading tremendously across the globe,resulted in pandemic declaration by World Health Organization. Related Information 
about COVID-19 COVID-19 may not be fatal but it spreads faster than other diseases, like common cold. Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many 
people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.

Currently the goal of all scientists around the world is to "Flatten the Curve". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in 
the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer 
timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month.
